This is a crop-recommender app(classification) which suggests which crop would grow optimally based on conditions like Nitrogen, Phosphorous,Potassium,temperature, humidity, PH and rainfall

    The user input parameters are as follows:

    N – Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
    P – Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
    K – Ratio of Potassium content in soil
    Temperature – temperature in degree Celsius
    Humidity – relative humidity in %
    ph – ph value of the soil
    Rainfall – rainfall in mm
